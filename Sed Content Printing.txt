******************* Printing content through SED *******************


1. First create a file using 'touch' as

	~/$ touch one.txt

2. Add content in the file using 'cat' as

	~/$ cat > one.txt

3. After adding content and saving content then use 'sed' command to print the content of 'one.txt' as

	~/$ sed -n '1p' 'one.txt' 	'p' stands for 'print operation'

   What the above command does is that it would print the 1st line in 'one.txt'

	~/$ sed -n '1,10p' 'one.txt'

   The above command will print lines of 'one.txt' from 1st till 10th line

	~/$ sed -n '1p;5p' 'one.txt'

   The above command will print 1st and the 5th line of 'one.txt' 

4. If we want to print range of lines we use " sed -n 'start,endp' 'file' "

5. If we want to print specific rows content then we use " sed -n '100p;150p' 'file' " (prints 100th row and 150th row of file)

6. If you want to get the content of 'one.txt' from 1st line till the last line and want to store this in output.txt then

	~/$ sed -n '1,$p' 'one.txt' > output.txt

6. Bonus Examples

	1.  Let's suppose you want to print some lines and want to store them in a separate file after printing them, 
	    then by using sed we can do this as

			~/$ sed -n '1,100p;150p;200,250p' 'one.txt' > output.txt

	    What the above command does is that it will execute sed -n '1,100p;150p;200,250p' 'one.txt' first and
            this will print lines of one.txt starting from 1st line till the 100th and then print 150th and then 
	    prints 200th till 250th and then store all these lines 1-100th,150th and 200-250th row content in output.txt

	2.  Let's say you want to read content from a file suppose 1st 100 lines of a file named 'hello.txt' and then you
	    want to print line numbers with the content then we can do this using sed as

			~/$ cat -n 'hello.txt' | sed -n '1,100p'
	
	    What the above command will do is that it will first execute cat -n 'hello.txt' what this command does is that
	    it will assign row numbers to all the lines in hello.txt and then pass all file content to sed -n '1,100p'
	    via "|" and then using sed you'll print 1st till 100th line content
