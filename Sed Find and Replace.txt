******************* Find and Replace through SED *******************

******************* On Screen Replacement *******************

1. At this point we know that sed works on line numbers in a file. Now to start with Find and Replace operation

	~/$ lscpu | cat -n | sed -n '1,15p' >  cpuspecs.txt

	The above command executes as

		1. First lscpu is executed which lists the specs of your cpu

		2. Then the output is given to cat -n using "|" what this will do is it will assign line numbers to
		   all the rows returned by lscpu in first step

		3. Then output with line numbers inserted before start of each line is give to sed -n '1,15p' using "|"
		   what this does is that it will pick 1st till 15th lines

		4. And finally the 15 lines worth of output is stored in cpuspecs.txt as

			     1  Architecture:                    x86_64
     			     2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     		 	     3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
                             4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
                             5  CPU(s):                          4
                             6  On-line CPU(s) list:             0-3
                             7  Thread(s) per core:              2
                             8  Core(s) per socket:              2
                             9  Socket(s):                       1
                             10  NUMA node(s):                    1
                             11  Vendor ID:                       GenuineIntel
                             12  CPU family:                      6
                             13  Model:                           85
                             14  Model name:                      Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.80GHz
                             15  Stepping:                        7


2. Now we'll work on spuspecs.txt which consists of 15 lines of text. Let us say we need to replace the word "Architectrue" with "Architecture,Architecture,Architecture"

	~/$ sed '1s/Architecture/Architecture,Architecture,Architecture/' cpuspecs.txt

	Let's understand what happens in above command step by step

		1. '1s' means substituting only in 1st line
		2. '1s/Archtecture/Architecture,Architecture,Architecture/' means in first line, if the word Architecture exists 
		    then replace it with Architecture,Architecture,Architecture
		3.  sed '1s/Architecture/Architecture,Architecture,Architecture/' cpuspecs.txt and from file cpuspecs.txt
		4.  Run
 
			sed '1s/Architecture/Architecture,Architecture,Architecture/' cpuspecs.txt | head -5

		    this command will get input from command '1s/Architecture/Architecture,Architecture,Architecture/' cpuspecs.txt
		    and then print only 1st 5 lines as
			    1  Architecture,Architecture,Architecture:                    x86_64
    			    2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     			    3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
                            4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
                            5  CPU(s):                          4
		5. Lets say we stored the above 5 lines in newspecs.txt as 

			sed '1s/Architecture/Architecture,Architecture,Architecture/' cpuspecs.txt | head -5  > newspecs.txt

		   Now the above 5 line output is stored in file newspecs.txt


3. At this point, we will now work with newspecs.txt. Use the following to view newspecs.txt content 
	
	~/$ cat newspecs.txt

	                    1  Architecture,Architecture,Architecture:                    x86_64
    			    2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     			    3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
                            4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
                            5  CPU(s):                          4


4. Again if at this stage, working with 'newspecs.txt', I use the following command

	~/$ sed '1s/Architecture/Architonics/' newspecs.txt

   After running the above command the output appears to be as 
	1  Architonics,Architecture,Architecture:                    x86_64
        2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
        3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
        4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
        5  CPU(s):                          4
   You noticed that when sed '1s/Architecture/Architonics/' newspecs.txt is executed, we are interested in making find and replace in 1st line 
   as 1s is used, you come to know that only 1st occurance of the word is replaced here. But we are interested in making replace of all 3 occurances
   of word Architecture in 1st line of 'newspecs.txt'

5. Now, if we want to make replacement to all occurances of a word in a file what we do is listed in below command
	
	~/$ sed '1s/Architecture/Architonics/g' newspecs.txt

     1  Architonics,Architonics,Architonics:                    x86_64
     2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
     4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
     5  CPU(s):                          4

     Now here 1s is used which means we are interested in making substitution in 1st line only and g flag is used at the end in '1s/Architecture/Architonics/g'
     which makes the replacement to all the occurances

6. Now, at this point if you execute ~/$ cat newspecs.txt you find that the orignal content is not replaced that's why we stored the output 
   of sed find and replace in an extra file in the 2nd step (2nd and its 5th sub step)


7. At this stage we again execute 
	
	~/$ cat newspecs.txt 
	
	output is as

     1  Architecture,Architecture,Architecture:                    x86_64
     2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
     4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
     5  CPU(s):                          4

	~/$ sed '5s/CPU/Architecture,NumberofCPUs/g' newspecs.txt  > updatedspecs.txt          
	
	"5s means 5th line g means all occurances of CPU" and output is stored in updatedspecs.txt
	
  After executing ~/$ cat updatedspecs.txt we find the content in it as

     1  Architecture,Architecture,Architecture:                    x86_64
     2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
     4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
     5  Architecture,NumberofCPUs(s):                          4


8. Now we'll work with 'updatedspecs.txt'. If you want to replace all the occurances of word Architecture in file 'updatedspecs.txt'
   
	~/$ sed 's/Architecture/Architonics/g' updatedspecs.txt         "s means all substitutions"

   Output

     1  Architonics,Architonics,Architonics:                    x86_64
     2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
     4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
     5  Architonics,NumberofCPUs(s):                          4

	
9. If we want to make substituions lets say if the Architecture word exist in 1st 2 lines and the 5th line as

	~/$ sed 's/CPU/Architecture/g' updatedspecs.txt

   Output

     1  Architecture,Architecture,Architecture:                    x86_64
     2  Architecture op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
     4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
     5  Architecture,NumberofArchitectures(s):                          4


10. Now we want to replace Architecture with architonics in between only 1st two lines of file and not the 5th line we do as

	~/$ sed 's/CPU/Architecture/g' updatedspecs.txt | sed '1,2s/Architecture/Architonics/g'                  "1,2s means starting from line 1 making subs till 2nd line"

   Output

     1  Architonics,Architonics,Architonics:                    x86_64
     2  Architonics op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
     4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
     5  Architecture,NumberofArchitectures(s):                          4 

11. Bonus Example

	~/$ cat newspecs.txt

     1  Architecture,Architecture,Architecture:                    x86_64
     2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
     4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
     5  CPU(s):                          4

	Now is we want an insensitive case matching as

	~/$ sed 's/ARCHITECTURE/Architonics/gi' newspecs.txt            "here i is used with g meaning globaly and insensitive replace architecure,ARCHITECTURE or what so ever be the upper,lower pattern"

    Output 

     1  Architonics,Architonics,Architonics:                    x86_64
     2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
     4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
     5  CPU(s):                          4

	~/$ sed '1s/Architecture/ARchitecTUre/g' newspecs.txt

    Output

     1  ARchitecTUre,ARchitecTUre,ARchitecTUre:                    x86_64
     2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
     4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
     5  CPU(s):                          4

	~/$ sed '1s/Architecture/ARchitecTUre/g' newspecs.txt | sed 's/ARCHITECTURE/Architonics/gi' > caseinsensitive.txt

	~$ cat caseinsensitive.txt | grep Architonics

    Output 
   
	1  Architonics,Architonics,Architonics:                    x86_64
	

	~/$ cat caseinsensitive.txt

     Output

     1  Architonics,Architonics,Architonics:                    x86_64
     2  CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
     3  Byte Order:                      Little Endian
     4  Address sizes:                   46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
     5  CPU(s):                          4

	~/$ sed '1s/Architonics/Architecture/3' caseinsensitive.txt | grep Architecture            #"Replace only 3rd occurance of word in 1st line"

     Output 

	1  Architonics,Architonics,Architecture:                    x86_64

	~$ sed 's/Architecture/Architonics/1' updatedspecs.txt | grep -i  Architonics

     Output

        1  Architonics,Architecture,Architecture:                    x86_64
        5  Architonics,NumberofCPUs(s):                          4
